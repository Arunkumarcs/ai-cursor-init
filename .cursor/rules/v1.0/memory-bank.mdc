# Memory Bank System

The Memory Bank is a persistent knowledge system that maintains AI context across sessions.
It ensures consistent, informed assistance by preserving project knowledge, decisions, and patterns.

## Memory Bank Location

All memory files are stored in: `memory-bank/`

## Core Memory Files

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `projectBrief.md` | Project overview, goals, scope | Rarely (foundation doc) |
| `productContext.md` | Why project exists, problems solved | When goals change |
| `systemPatterns.md` | Architecture, patterns, decisions | When patterns evolve |
| `techContext.md` | Tech stack, dependencies, setup | When stack changes |
| `activeContext.md` | Current work, focus areas | Every session |
| `progress.md` | Status, completions, blockers | After milestones |

## Additional Memory Files

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `decisions.md` | ADRs with context, alternatives, consequences | When decisions made |
| `errors.md` | Known issues, debugging tips, common fixes | When bugs discovered |

## Behavior Rules

### On Session Start
1. Read ALL memory bank files before responding
2. Understand current project context and active work
3. Review recent decisions and patterns

### During Session
1. Apply patterns from `systemPatterns.md` consistently
2. Follow conventions documented in memory files
3. Update `activeContext.md` when work focus changes
4. Reference `errors.md` when debugging similar issues

### On Significant Changes
1. Update relevant memory files when:
   - New architectural decisions are made
   - Patterns or conventions are established
   - Technical stack changes
   - Major features are completed
   - Bugs or gotchas are discovered

### Memory Update Commands
- `/memory-update` - Prompt to update memory files based on session
- `/memory-status` - Show current memory bank contents
- `/memory-init` - Initialize/reset memory bank

## File Format Guidelines

Each memory file should:
- Use clear Markdown formatting
- Include `> Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD` header for staleness tracking
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Cross-reference related files when needed

## Context Management

### File Size Guidelines
- Keep individual files under 500 lines
- Use summaries at top of each file
- Archive old content to `memory-bank/archive/`

### Staleness Indicators
- Files not updated in 30+ days should be reviewed
- Check `Last Updated` timestamps at session start

## Integration with Rules

Memory Bank works alongside `.cursor/rules/`:
- Rules define HOW to code (patterns, style)
- Memory defines WHAT we're building (context, decisions)

## Auto-Context Loading

When `alwaysApply: true`, this rule ensures:
1. Memory context is always available
2. Responses are consistent with project history
3. No context is lost between sessions
